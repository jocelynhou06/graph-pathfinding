# Graph Traversal and Pathfinding System

A Java-based system implementing DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra’s algorithm for graph traversal and shortest-path computation, integrated with a GUI for visualization.

## Features
- Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms
- Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest-path computation
- Weighted graph and priority queue data structures
- GUI visualization of graph traversal

## Technologies
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data Structures and Algorithms

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jocelynhou06/graph-pathfinding.git`
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
3. Run the main class `Main.java`
